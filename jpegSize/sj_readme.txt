sj.bat will create images of the size 1200x900 or 900x1200
from jpeg-files in the same directory as the script is run. The
new files will be added to the directory "portable" (this will be
created if it does not exist beforehand). 


For this you will need:
Python 2.7 with python path set
Python Image Library Installed

Usage:

1) Make sure that the sj.py and sj.bat in the same directory as the
   photos you want to create smaller versions of.

2) Excecute the batch file.

3) Wait until the operations are completed.

4) Press space or close the command console window when the operations
   are completed.
